- [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf) - CSRF protection middleware for Go.
- [gorilla/csrf](https://github.com/gorilla/csrf) - Provides Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention middleware for Go web applications & services.
- [gorilla/securecookie](https://github.com/gorilla/securecookie) - Encodes and decodes authenticated and optionally encrypted cookie values for Go web applications.
- [secure](https://github.com/unrolled/secure) -  Secure is an HTTP middleware for Go that facilitates most of your security needs for web applications.
- [unindexed](https://github.com/jordan-wright/unindexed) - A drop-in replacement for `http.Dir` which disables directory indexing.
- [beego-security-headers](https://github.com/gosecguy/beego-security-headers) - beego framework filter for easy security headers management.

## Libraries

- [paseto](https://github.com/o1egl/paseto) - Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens implementation in GO (Golang).
- [hsts](https://github.com/StalkR/hsts) - Go HTTP Strict Transport Security library.
- [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) - Golang implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) - Take a list of domains and probe for working HTTP and HTTPS servers.

## Static Code Analysis

- [safesql](https://github.com/stripe/safesql) - Static analysis tool for Golang that protects against SQL injections. It does not seem to be actively maintained at the moment.
- [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) - Inspects source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST and matching it with a set of rules. Comes bundled in a Docker container [securego/gosec](https://hub.docker.com/r/securego/gosec).
- [gometalinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter) - Concurrently runs most of the existing go linters and normalizes their output.
- [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql) - A tool that lets you query your code like data, in order to find vulnerabilities and bugs. See also [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) for pull request integration and running queries in the cloud.
- [ChainJacking](https://github.com/Checkmarx/chainjacking) - Find which of your Go lang direct GitHub dependencies is susceptible to ChainJacking attack.
